Hello there!

/* todo: X, Y, Z, N */
In the last 90 days, X files were modified, totaling Y insertions and Z deletions, in N commits. The primary goal was integrating an intermediate representation!

## Compiler ire...?

The compiler didn't get angry, but now outputs instructions in a new intermediate representation, that is then compiled to bytecode for the virtual machine!

Why the extra step, you might ask? I wanted to be able to add super instructions, which relies on merging some instructions together. Introducing an IR that's easy to handle seems like a good fit for this task.

## More optimizations!
