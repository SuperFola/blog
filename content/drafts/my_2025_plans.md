It's been about 46 days since the new year has started, but my brain hasn't adjusted (yet) to us being in 2025 and not 2024. That's why I'm only getting started now on establishing my goals for the new year!

## ArkScript, version 4.0.0

This year, I want to finish ArkScript v4 (or at least all the tasks I planned for this major version), and finally get some rest, working on less intensive tasks, take more time to use the language and improve the standard library (eg contribute to [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:ArkScript) with ArkScript).

I'd also love to be working on the modules again, maybe even rewrite [arksfml](https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/arksfml) (either to finally make it work again or use raylib as it is more imperative and feels more suited to ArkScript object model.

## Fun coding

do some small challenges, make small games
rosetta code

## Hardware project(s)

## Recap

- ArkScript v4
- update the modules for ArkScript v4
- back to video games using ArkScript
- do some scripting with the language for anything
- make small games
- design a new keyboard
- write some blog posts
