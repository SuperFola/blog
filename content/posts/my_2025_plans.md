It's been about 46 days since the new year has started, but my brain hasn't adjusted (yet) to us being in 2025 and not 2024. That's why I'm only getting started now on establishing my goals for the new year!

## ArkScript, version 4.0.0

This year, I want to finish ArkScript v4 (or at least all the tasks I planned for this major version), and finally get some rest, working on less intensive tasks, take more time to use the language and improve the standard library (eg contribute to [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:ArkScript) with ArkScript).

I'd also love to be working on the modules again, maybe even rewrite [arksfml](https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/arksfml) (either to finally make it work again or use raylib as it is more imperative and feels more suited to ArkScript object model.

## Fun coding

In December 2024, I started completing the Advent of Code [using ArkScript](https://github.com/SuperFola/advent_of_code_2024) and it was super fun, as well as challenging! I would like to take some time to work on those challenges this year, maybe make visualisations or tools to help writing solutions.

A while ago (what feels like 10 years ago) I was making games and having fun. Of course the games were either too big, unscoped or I lost motivation to work on them. I'd like to work on games again, but way smaller ones, because the feedback loop is incredible: you type some code, run, you have something graphical that changed in your window.

## Hardware project(s)

Two years ago, I dabbled in the ergonomic keyboard world. Last year, I designed my own keyboard, the [Arkenswoop](https://github.com/SuperFola/arkenswoop), which I'm using to write this article. I've also designed [the floppy]({{< ref "/posts/floppy_keyboard" >}}) in November 2024, and making a keyboard from scratch, assembling it and using it every day at work made me want to do more.

For now I have little to no idea for the next keyboard I want to design, but I'm sure of one thing: I want and I will design yet another keyboard, because it is just so fun! Putting traces on the PCB in Kicad, moving the keys around on paper to find something I could like, assembling the keyboard and discovering all the quirks I added by mistake, fixing them, programming a firmware for it and then using something I made from scratch feels very rewarding.

## Recap

- ArkScript v4
- update the modules for ArkScript v4
- back to video games (using ArkScript?)
- do some scripting with the language for anything
- make small games
- design a new keyboard
- write some blog posts

Until we meet again!
