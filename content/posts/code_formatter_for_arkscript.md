why?
uniformity, creating a norm

complexe piece of code
how do you split code on multiple lines and when

do not remove comments because they aren't nodes, so finding to which node we should attach them is touch

making it idempotent
-> finding bugs in the parser and the tracking of lines/col number

the result
about 500-600ish lines of code, but by far a lot more complex than the compiler (> 3000 lines)
